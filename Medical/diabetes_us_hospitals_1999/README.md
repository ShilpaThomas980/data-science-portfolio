# Diabetes Patient Readmission Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting hospital readmissions for diabetes patients using a publicly available dataset collected from 130 US hospitals between 1999 and 2008. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can identify patients at risk of readmission, helping healthcare providers improve patient outcomes and resource allocation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized patient records, including demographic information, medical history, treatments, and readmission status. It covers data collected over nearly a decade, providing a rich source for predictive modeling.

## Methodology
- Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, identify missing values, and detect relevant features.
- Developed and trained four machine learning models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
  - Neural Network  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and ROC AUC score as key metrics.

## Results
- The Neural Network model achieved the best results with:  
  - Accuracy: **77%**  
  - ROC AUC Score: **0.58**  
- These results suggest moderate predictive power and highlight opportunities for further feature engineering and model tuning.
